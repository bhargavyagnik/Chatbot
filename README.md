It is a chatbot to answer your queries regarding anything
This is an approach to solve the queries we ask on Google for Wikipedia answers regarding anything that is found on the net.
Be it of New York or Narendra Modi, this project would help you get the desired answers.
We are using 
```bash
pip install wikipedia
```
wikipedia.summary can be used to get an abstract summary that we are currently using. In future I am planning to use of whole page.
 
Currently I have approached the solution using TF-IDF and an effort is going on to use Glove to make this model more better and improve accuracy of the chatbot.
